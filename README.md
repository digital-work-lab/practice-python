Hello and welcome to our notebooks for practicing Python!
The notebooks are designed as an introductory resource for [The Open-Source Project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/).

We recommend to run the notebooks in GitHub Codespaces:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=digital-work-lab/practice-python)

The session consists of two parts, one notebook for each:

| Notebook                             | Time (min) | 
|--------------------------------------|------------|
| [Python 1](notebooks/python_1.ipynb) | 90         |
| [Python 2](notebooks/python_2.ipynb) | 90         |
